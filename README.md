# Kingfisher-for-Obsidian
Obsidian dark theme based off of Blackbird

![[Example.png]]

This is a simple, clean dark mode theme designed to be easy on the eyes with warm colors.  Who knows if I'll continue to update it, mostly putting it out there for myself but if it picks up any traction I'll make additions as time permits.
